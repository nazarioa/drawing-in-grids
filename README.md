# Draw!

First pass at a simple [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) project.

What it does, allows you draw by running your mouse over a grid of `Cell` elements.

The Cells are rendered in the `App` element and uses css `display: grid`.

I read the ReactJS documentation two days ago so I will be coming back to this
project as I learn ReactJS best practices.

To play with it:
1. Clone the repo
2. from the command-line, cd into the cloned directory
3. run `npm run draw`

You can also just see it live [here](https://www.niztech.com/Client/drawing-in-grids/)
